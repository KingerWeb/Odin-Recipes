            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
                <li>4 chicken breasts, boneless skinless</li>
                    <li>salt</li>

            <li>1 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon water</li>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol><li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In separate bowls, place cornstarch and slightly beaten eggs. Dip chicken into cornstarch, then coat in egg mixture. I have also found that you can put the cornstarch in a gallon-sized bag and shake the chicken to coat it.</li>
                <li>Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken until browned. Place the chicken in a 9 x 13 greased baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Combine the Buffalo sauce, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, water, salt, and red pepper flakes in a medium-sized mixing bowl.</li>
                        <li>Pour the sauce over the chicken and bake for 1 hour, stirring the chicken every 15 minutes.</li></ol>
